# ClazzFish

ClazzFish is a collection of different modules, which help you to dive into the classpath of your application and to monitor it.
Originally it was part of [PatternTesting](http://patterntesting.org) but is now extracted to a separate project.



## Roadmap

With v0.5 and v0.8 the first steps are done - the transfer of ClasspathMonitor and ResourcepathMonitor from the [PatternTesting](http://patterntesting.org) project.
The next steps will be:

* provide basic documentation, code cleanup, polishing
* use of [fast-classpath-scanner](https://github.com/lukehutch/fast-classpath-scanner) to dive into the classpath
* extend documentation



## More Infos

* Release Notes: [src/doc/RELEASES](src/doc/RELEASES.adoc)
* [SQL Logging and Montitoring](src/doc/SQL-Logging.adoc)
