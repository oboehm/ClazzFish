# ClazzFish

ClazzFish is a collection of different modules, which help you to dive into the classpath of your application and to monitor it.
Originally it was part of [PatternTesting](http://patterntesting.org) but is now extracted to a separate project.



## History

With v0.5 and v0.8 the first steps were done - the transfer of ClasspathMonitor and ResourcepathMonitor from the [PatternTesting](http://patterntesting.org) project.
V1.x is mainly for Java 8.
V2.x will support Java 9 and beyond and uses now the [fast-classpath-scanner](https://github.com/lukehutch/fast-classpath-scanner) to dive into the classpath.
